# Regression Analysis: Confounding Hypotheses and Predictive Insights
Odnetnin Co., Ltd., a global gaming software company, launched the Employee Comprehensive Health Option (ECHO) Program in 2009 to promote employee wellness. The program includes a 24/7 fitness center and wellness education. A year-long study assessed employees' healthiness, ECHO engagement, and health-related costs to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The study examined whether ECHO engagement directly reduces health-related costs (the “direct effect hypothesis”) or if the relationship is influenced by healthier individuals participating more and incurring lower costs (the “confounding hypothesis”). Using R, this repository analyzes these relationships with simple and multiple regression models, exploring the role of confounding factors.
