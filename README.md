# Regression Analysis: Confounding Hypotheses and Predictive Insights
Odnetnin Co., Ltd., a global gaming software company, launched the Employee Comprehensive Health Option (ECHO) Program in 2009 to promote employee wellness. The program includes a 24/7 fitness center and wellness education. A year-long study assessed employees' healthiness, ECHO engagement, and health-related costs to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The study examined whether ECHO engagement directly reduces health-related costs (the “direct effect hypothesis”) or if the relationship is influenced by healthier individuals participating more and incurring lower costs (the “confounding hypothesis”). Using R, this repository analyzes these relationships with simple and multiple regression models, exploring the role of confounding factors.

## Intended Use
**Purpose:**  
This repository aims to investigate and demonstrate the role of correlation between independent variables in regression analysis. Key objectives include:

**Exploring Confounding Effects:** Analyze how the correlation between independent variables affects their relationships with the dependent variable in both bivariate and multivariate contexts.
**Examining Predictor Interplay:** Highlight the influence of highly correlated predictors (e.g., healthiness and engagement) on regression outcomes, focusing on their direct versus mediated effects.
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the impact of correlation on simple and multiple regression models, including coefficients, significance, and explanatory power (e.g., adjusted R-squared, partial determination).
**Practical Insights:** Provide a framework for identifying and interpreting confounding hypotheses in real-world datasets, emphasizing the distinction between direct causality and mediated associations.
**Statistical Application:** Use R to model, visualize, and explain the interplay between variables, reinforcing practical skills in regression analysis for applied research.
